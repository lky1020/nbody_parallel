 Distributed System and Parallel Computing - Assignment

ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ This project is for Assignment of Distributed System and Parallel Computing. In this project, It will use Barnes-Hut Algorithm to replace All-Pair algorithm for the n-body simulation. The original sourcec code is taken from [Ligh7bringer](https://github.com/Ligh7bringer/Nbody-parallel).ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

# Limitations in the Project
1. Hard to control the center of mass and total mass for the n-body simulation with Barnes-Hut Algorithm.
2. Does not perform the calculation of Center of Mass and Total Mass
3. The first Body (Sun) will not able to move with other bodies after implementing Barnes-Hut Algorithm, Sun will be move out the simulation due to problem of no1 & no2.
